    <p>Michael Jordan played in the NBA for 15 years but in 3 different stints. His first stint consisted of 9 years and is regarded by almost all basketball analysts as the "prime" of his career. Other than the 85-86 season when he broke his foot and was forced to miss 64 games, Michael was able to show great consistency during these years as he won 3 mvp's and 3 championships. On October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement from the game due to what he referred to as "a loss of desire to play the game." He came back after 1 year of playing baseball and went on to win 2 more mvp's and 3 more championships, an indication that he was still playing at a top level in the league. Michael Jordan decided to retire once again, this time marking the end of his career in Chicago, where he built his legacy. Michael came back to play for the Wizards for two more years but was no longer the same player he once was before.</p>
