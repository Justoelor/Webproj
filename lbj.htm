    <p>Say what you want about Lebron James, but one has to admit that his durability is absolutely remarkable. Lebron is now playing in his 16th season and is still considered one of the very best players in the league. To put that in perspective, only 7 active players have been playing in the NBA longer than him, and none of them even average 10 points or start anymore at this point in their careers. Further padding his resume, Lebron has never missed more than 13 games in a season, which means he has never had a significant injury in his whole career. Keep in mind also that Lebron is at the top of the league in minutes played every year as well, which means he has constantly put significant miles on his body to help his respective team</p>
