    <h2><b>Lebron James vs Michael Jordan</b></h2>
    <h4><i>By Justo Elortondo</i></h4>
</div>
    <p>Welcome to my first ever Web Page built from scratch using HTML! To be honest, I didn't even know this computer language existed before I took this class, but I have been pleasantly surprised by its endless capabilities for creating content. While studying this computer language, trying to learn the different tags and how to apply them, I frequently thought about what type of webpage I should build with it. Then the idea suddenly hit me; I am passionate about basketball and I believed HTML offered great resources to be able to answer one of the sports most debated questions. Who is better, 
        <a href="lbj.html">Lebron James</a> 
        (left) or 
        <a href="mj.html">Michael Jordan</a> 
        (right)?</p>
<div>
    <img src="lebronjames.jpg" alt="Bron" width="250" height="160">

<p>Comparing the careers of two players is always difficult, especially when the two players played in different eras. Michael Jordan played from '84 to '03 with brief stints away from the NBA (which we will discuss later) and Lebron started his career in '03 and is still playing today. To set an equal standard for both players we will look at 3 key measures that help us set apart two remarkably accomplished athletes. To compare the following measures, click on the respective athlete's name for which you wish to examine.

<ol>
    <li>Productivity</li>
    <li>Accolades</li>
    <li>Longevity</li>
</ol>
<p class='special'>
So what is the Answer?</p>
<p>In the end you are splitting hairs! Both players have achieved remarkable success and it depends on what you value personally to decide who is better. Lebron has better all-around statistics and has been a little more durable, however Jordan's accolades are unmatched and most likely will never be reached by Lebron.</p>
